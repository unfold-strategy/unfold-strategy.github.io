        <p class="question">Why do carefully designed initiatives often fall short of expectations?</p>
        <p class="lead">As a leader, you're probably achieving reasonable results with your current approach. Your team makes solid plans, executes carefully, and generally moves in the right direction.</p>
        <p class="lead">But you might notice some persistent patterns:</p>
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>Strategic initiatives that look great on paper but don't quite deliver expected results</li>
          <li>Recurring challenges that return in slightly different forms</li>
          <li>Opportunities that become obvious only in retrospect</li>
          <li>Changes that create unexpected ripple effects</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">What if these patterns are pointing us toward opportunities that conventional approaches miss?</p>
