        <h1 class="hero">Beyond Traditional Strategy</h1>

        <p class="lead">You've likely recognized some persistent patterns in how strategic initiatives play out - solid plans that don't quite deliver expected results, recurring challenges that return in new forms, opportunities that become obvious only in retrospect.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Beyond Plans to Practice</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>Many leaders think of strategy as an artifact - a document, deck, or framework that guides decisions. But the most effective leaders recognize that strategy lives in the choices they make every day.</p>
          <p>Think about the decisions you've made in the past week:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Which initiatives to prioritize</li>
            <li>How to respond to unexpected challenges</li>
            <li>Where to focus your team's energy</li>
            <li>When to change course versus stay the course</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each of these choices shapes your strategic reality more than any document could. The question isn't whether you're creating strategy - it's whether you're seeing the full range of possibilities available to you.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>When these patterns become challenging enough, organizations typically turn to strategic consultants. They analyze, interview, and deliver recommendations based on best practices and industry patterns.</p>
          <p>But there's a fundamental limitation: External experts can only work with the patterns they can see in the time they have. The deepest insights about your customers, market, and organization - the patterns that could reveal your biggest opportunities - often remain just out of reach.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">A Different Way Forward</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>Instead of relying on temporary external expertise, there's another possibility: developing strategic capabilities that transform how you see and create opportunities.</p>
          <p>Think about discovering a new word and suddenly hearing it everywhere. The world hasn't changed - you just have a new way of seeing it. That's what developing these capabilities feels like. You'll have access to all the same information, but you'll see it with new depth and possibility.</p>
          <p>Working together, you'll:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recognize patterns in your strategic landscape that others miss</li>
            <li>See connections between seemingly unrelated challenges and opportunities</li>
            <li>Sense emerging possibilities before they become obvious to others</li>
            <li>Design approaches that create lasting positive change</li>
            <li>Build momentum through aligned action rather than force</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Why This Matters Now</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>In today's complex environment, sustainable success depends less on having the right answers and more on asking better questions. The strategic capabilities you develop won't just serve a single initiative - they'll transform how you approach every leadership challenge for the rest of your career.</p>
